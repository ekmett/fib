[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/fib.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/fib)

This project may eventually supply a small portable C++ library for light-weight fibers.

The task scheduling subsystem is based on [Scheduling Parallel Programs by Work Stealing with Private Deques](http://www.chargueraud.org/research/2013/ppopp/full.pdf) by Acar, Chargu√©raud and Rainey.
